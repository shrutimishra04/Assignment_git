# Git Assignment â€“ Shruti Mishra

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my Git practical assignment, demonstrating various Git operations such as repository initialization, remote operations, branching, merging, reset types, stashing, and pull requests.

## ðŸ“‚ Steps Covered
1. Initialized a local Git repository and practiced staging/unstaging.
2. Linked with remote GitHub repo, pushed/pulled commits.
3. Created and merged a feature branch (`g1`) via Pull Request.
4. Practiced `git reset` (soft, mixed, hard), `git add -p`, `git diff`, and `git ls-files`.
5. Created and merged branches (`b1`, `b2`, `b3`) and resolved merge conflicts.
6. Forked the repository, cloned the fork, added changes, and created a PR.
7. Performed a complex staging/unstaging challenge using `git stash`, `git add -p`, and conflict resolution.
